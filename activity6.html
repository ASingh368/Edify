          Being happy is a great thing! However it is not just a single term,
          but rather it refers to a variety of emotions. It can make us feel
          energetic or feel slow, this could hinder our productivity because we
          can't slow down our mind in this state. Let us take a break first and
          calm our mind before moving on with our learning. To do this, we'll
          play a simple game
        </p>
        <button
          class="custom-btn btn-1"
          id="play_now"

      <!-- ===== ANXIOUS TEXT ===== -->
      <div class="texts" id="anxious-text" style="display: none">
        <p>
          Sometimes it might be helpful to write down exactly what we're going
          through in a journal. It can be relieving and relaxing and reduce the
          anxious or depressing thoughts. Write your worries and thoughts here
          or maybe what you did today, once you are done read it to yourself and
          see if it helps!
        </p>
        <textarea name="journal" rows="20" cols="90">
            Write how you feel and what's bothering you here.

            impossible to calm down right now but why dont we try out a breathing 
            exercise and see if that could help us relax abit before we continue 
            with our learning?
