      <p class="paragraph">
        We all have days where we don’t feel good about ourselves. This is
        perfectly normal. If you have days were you feel more down than up, it
        can really boost your mood to volunteer or help someone in need. For
        example, you can, check for permission first, do something nice for
        someone. Perhaps help open a door for an elderly person or help at an
        animal shelter to help animals. There are many things you can do to make
        a difference! It’s has been shown that the more different the helping or
        volunteering activity is for you – the better! 
    </br></br> *Please ask permission
        before volunteering and also ask the person you are helping. For
        example, many people who are disabled do not want to be helped unless
        they ask.
